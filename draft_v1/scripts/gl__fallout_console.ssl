/*
    Global script for the Fallout 2 ~ console by Mrowr Purr

    This must run before all other scripts so that it
    can register the handler for `register_console_proc`
    to work when called from other mods.

    Do not try to include this script in yours mods,
    there is no need. Instead #include "Console.h".
